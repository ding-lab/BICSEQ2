Project_config files may evolve over time.  Having common elements would be helpful.

For now, main difference between them, aside from project names, is that GENE_BED may be obtained either 
from workflow directory or from mapped directory (e.g. data4, as is done in execute_workflow)


* early Jan 19
Starting with project_config.execute_workflow.C3L-chr.MGI.sh, OUTD is changed from /data1/PROJECT to /data1,
and it no longer has `mkdir`.  It is the responsibility of the calling container to create the appropriate
directories.  This is done so that host-based log files can be associated with the run output
Project is not defined in project_config right now

* 1/11/19 
Output base directory is set in script via argument rather than defined in project_config; by default it is /data1
Renamed to OUTD_BASE.  Reference implementation:
-> /docker_call/run_cases.LUAD.MGI/project_config.run_cases.LUAD.MGI.sh


* 1/17/19
Change "PDF" -> "PNG"
