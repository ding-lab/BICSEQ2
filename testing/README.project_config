Project_config files may evolve over time.  Having common elements would be helpful.

For now, main difference between them, aside from project names, is that GENE_BED may be obtained either 
from workflow directory or from mapped directory (e.g. data4, as is done in execute_workflow)


Starting with project_config.execute_workflow.C3L-chr.MGI.sh, OUTD is changed from /data1/PROJECT to /data1,
and it no longer has `mkdir`.  It is the responsibility of the calling container to create the appropriate
directories.  This is done so that host-based log files can be associated with the run output
Project is not defined in project_config right now

These changes should be propagated to other project_config and tested
