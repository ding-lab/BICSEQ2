# `run_sample.C3L-chr.katmai`


Test the following per-sample workflow steps on C3L-chr dataset:
* Normalization
* Segmentation
* Gene annotation

Note that for now, NOT doing `get_unique` step, instead using `.seq` files provided by previous
runs.

Project configuration in `project_config.run_sample.C3L-chr.katmai.sh`

C3L-chr test dataset consists of chrom 18,19,20 from C3L-00004 CPTAC3 dataset.  It is defined
in `/BICSEQ2/testing/test_data/chromosomes.18-20.dat`

Reference and mapping data on katmai at `/diskmnt/Projects/CPTAC3CNV/BICSEQ2/inputs/hg38`

Directory mapping, when launching docker:
*   data1:/diskmnt/Projects/CPTAC3CNV/BICSEQ2/inputs  
    * Mappability files 
    * Per-chrom reference in ./hg38
*   data2:/diskmnt/Projects/CPTAC3CNV/BICSEQ2/outputs/UCEC.hg38.test/run_uniq  
    * Per-sample, per-chrom .seq files as generated by Yige for production run
*   data3:/diskmnt/Datasets/BICSEQ2-dev.tmp 
    * Output directory of this project
*   data4:/diskmnt/Datasets/Reference/GRCh38.d1.vd1 
    * Path to all-chrom reference
    * This information used in preparation step, not used here, kept because it is expected

This is incorporated into `0_launch_docker.sh`
