* It is not clear that get_unique is actually parallelized.  Seems to wait for 
  each chrom to complete
* Each step creates its own output directory.  Do not create them all at once,
  So can keep track of progress according to output directory created
* Confirm --tmpdir works in get_unique - crashed with disk full errors
