* It is not clear that get_unique is actually parallelized.  Seems to wait for 
  each chrom to complete
* Each step creates its own output directory.  Do not create them all at once,
  So can keep track of progress according to output directory created

Update 1/7/19
* Run succeeds, but results are different than those from Yige's prior run here:
  - /diskmnt/Projects/CPTAC3CNV/BICSEQ2/outputs/BICSEQ2.UCEC.hg38.121/get_gene_level_cnv

  Specifically, 
	* /data1/run_sample.C3L-00008.katmai/annotation/C3L-00008.gene_level.log2.seg
	* /diskmnt/Projects/CPTAC3CNV/BICSEQ2/outputs/BICSEQ2.UCEC.hg38.121/get_gene_level_cnv/C3L-00008.gene_level.log2.seg
  differ.  Need to track down upstream source of these errors
