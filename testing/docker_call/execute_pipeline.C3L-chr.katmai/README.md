# `execute_pipeline.C3L-chr.katmai`

Test complete workflow on C3L-chr dataset.  This is based on direct_call/execute_workflow.3L-chr.katmai

Here, calling `execute_workflow.sh` from host.

Testing now (1/8/19): all-chrom run on C3L-00006, tmux session execute_pipeline.C3L-chr.katmai.  
* Note that direct runs died because $ANND directory not created
* Also, investigate why parallel seems to be running only one job at a time
